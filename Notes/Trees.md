## My notes on Trees
- Binary trees
  - Non recursive no stack, in order traversal using Morris method
  - Binary trees can be used to model airport runway reservation Systems as we need a system with constraints that can be verified on insertion, fast delete, traversal. Binary Trees can get that done in O(lg n)
  - To create augmented trees where you can calculate how many nodes are smaller than a particular node of a tree, store the subtree size of each node with that node. If a node's subtree has 3 children, store 4 in the node. 
- AVL Trees
